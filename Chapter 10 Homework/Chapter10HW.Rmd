a) Would it be appropriate to use a normal approximation in conducting a
statistical test of the research hypothesis that over half of persons suffering
from chonic pain are over 50 years of age?
```{r, message= FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```

b)Using the data in the survey, is there substantial evidence ($\alpha$ = 0.05) 
that more than half of persons suffering from chronic pain are over 50 years
of age?
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

c) Place a 95% confidence interval on the proportion of person suffering from 
chronic pain that are over 50 years of age.  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```
