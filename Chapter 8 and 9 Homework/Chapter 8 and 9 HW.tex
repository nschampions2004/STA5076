\section*{Chapter 8 and 9 Homework}
\subsection*{Due 3-18-2018}
\subsubsection*{Problem 9.13}
\subsubsection*{ a) Assess ANOVA assumptions using the graph from PROC MIXED.}

In order to proceed with ANOVA, we must check for the following pieces:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=+.5in]
 	\item[$\bullet$] No obvious pattern in our Residual Scatterplot
	\item[$\bullet$] Normal shape to the Residual Histogram.
 	\item[$\bullet$] Residuals fit along the linear prediction of our Actual "Normality" to the Theoretical Normal Model.  
\end{itemize}

Since there is no readily observable pattern in our residuals, our distribution is mound shaped, and our Residuals fit the along the Q-Q plot(although, there may be evidence of a right skew), we will proceed with ANOVA to see if at least one mean is different.

\subsubsection*{ b) Perform ANOVA to determine if there is a difference among the five weight-reducing agents, $\alpha$ = 0.05.}

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}
\hline\hline
Row Names & SS & df & MS & F & P-Value \\ [0.5ex]

Treatments (T) & 61.618 & 4 & 15.4045 & 15.6805 & 4.16x$10^{-8}$ \\
Error (E) & 44.207 & 45 & 0.9824 & \\
Total & 105.825 & 49 &  \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:nonlin}
\end{table}

Hypotheses:
\begin{blockquote}
$H_{0}$: $\mu_{a1}$ = $\mu_{a2}$ = $\mu_{a3}$ = $\mu_{a4}$ = $\mu_{s}$ \\
$H_{1}$: At least one mean is different.  
\end{blockquote}
Test Statistic:
\begin{blockquote}
F = 15.6805
\end{blockquote}
Rejection Region:
\begin{blockquote}
Reject $H_{0}$ if $F_{0} > F_{\alpha, 4, 45}$ \\
$F_{0.95, 4 , 45} = 5.72$
\end{blockquote}
Conclusion/Interpretation:
\begin{blockquote}
Since our $F_{0} > 5.72$, there is strong enough evidence to support rejecting the null hypothesis that the means are the same.  The data provided does suggest at least one mean is different from the rest.  
\end{blockquote}


\subsubsection*{ c) Determine significantly different pairs using Tukey's W with $\alpha$ = 0.05}
\begin{blockquote}
To find which groups are different from each other, we will utilize Tukey's W to check which means are different from one another.  We will verify this by checking which one's p-values are less than 0.05 after using the TukeyHSD test on our ANOVA Model in R.  
\end{blockquote}
Conclusion/Interpretation
\begin{blockquote}
With our Tukey W test being run, the differences lie in the following means:
\end{blockquote}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=+0.5in]
	\item[$\bullet$] S differs with $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, and $A_{4}$
	\item[$\bullet$] $A_{3}$ differs with $A_{1}$ and $A_{4}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{ d) Determine which, if any, of the new agents have significantly larger mean weight loss as compared to the standard agent; $\alpha$ = 0.05}

\begin{blockquote} 
Using s as our control, we will performs Dunnett's test to determine if there's a significantly larger difference with the new agents.  The first step in checking out if any of the new agents are yielding better weight loss results is to find Dunnett's D.  
\end{blockquote}

\begin{eqnarray}
D = d_{\alpha}(k,v)\sqrt{\frac{2s^{2}_{W}}{n}} \nonumber \\ 
D = d_{0.05}(4,45)\sqrt{\frac{2(0.982)}{10}} \nonumber \\
D = 2.23\sqrt{\frac{1.964}{10}} \nonumber \\
D = 2.23(0.4432) \nonumber \\
D = 0.9888 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Dunnett's Control Test}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
\hline\hline
Treatment & $\bar{y}_{i}-\bar{y}_{c}$ & Comparison & Conclusion \\ [0.5ex] 
\hline
a1 & 2.78 & $>$ D & Greater Than Control \\
a2 & 1.75 & $>$ D & Greater Than Control \\
a3 & 1.00 & $>$ D & Greater Than Control \\ 
a4 & 2.97 & $>$ D & Greater Than Control \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:nonlin}
\end{table}    

Conclusion/Interpretation:
\begin{blockquote}
All four of the agents are statistically significant. Thus, we can reject the null hypotheses that the difference in weight loss metrics between the original agent(s) and the new agents($a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},$ and $a_{4}$) is zero.  Each of the new agents appear to have an increase in weight loss over the agent s.    
\end{blockquote}

\subsubsection*{9.17 - construct the contrasts}

\subsubsection*{a) Assess ANOVA assumptions using the graph from PROC MIXED}
In order to proceed with ANOVA, we must check for the following pieces:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=+.5in]
 	\item[$\bullet$] No obvious pattern in our Residual Scatterplot
	\item[$\bullet$] Normal shape to the Residual Histogram.
 	\item[$\bullet$] Residuals fit along the linear prediction of our Actual "Normality" to the Theoretical Normal Model.  
\end{itemize}

There appears to be a pattern in the residuals.  The best way to describe the pattern is a increasing fan shape at the edges.  There is an increase in the residuals as you are on the extremes of the means of each group.  Finally, a pattern in the Q-Q plot has this sample data straying from the Normal model by mismatching the Normal model outside of the -1 and + 1.5 standard deviations.

\subsubsection*{b) Run an ANOVA on the data to see if there is a difference in the suppliers}
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{ANOVA Table for Supplier's Variability in Power}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}
\hline\hline
Row Names & SS & df & MS & F & P-Value \\ [0.5ex] 
\hline
Suppliers (S) & 28024 & 4 & 7006 & 865.9 & $<$ 2x$10^{-16}$ \\
Error (E) & 1054 & 40 & 26 & \\
Total & 29078 & 44 &  \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:nonlin}
\end{table}
Hypotheses:
\begin{blockquote}
$H_{0}: \mu_{S1} = \mu_{S2} = \mu_{S3} = \mu_{S4} = \mu_{S5}$ \\
$H_{1}:$ At least one mean is different.  
\end{blockquote}

Test Statistic:
\begin{blockquote}
F = 865.9
\end{blockquote}

Rejection Region:
\begin{blockquote}
Reject $H_{0}$ if $F_{0} > F_{\alpha,4,20}$
$F_{0.05,4,25}$ = 5.80
\end{blockquote}

Conclusion/Interpretation:
\begin{blockquote}
With a test statistic greater than the rejection bound, there does seem to extreme enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal.  It does appear that at least one mean is different.  
\end{blockquote}

\subsubsection*{c) Perform a Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if there is a difference among the suppliers; $\alpha$ = 0.05}
Hypothesis:
\begin{blockquote}
$H_{0}$: There is no difference among the five suppliers with respect to median Variability in Power. \\
$H_{1}$: At least one of the five suppliers' medians differs from the others.   
\end{blockquote}

Test Statistic:
\begin{blockquote}
H = 41.596 with 4 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 2.023x$10^{-8}$
\end{blockquote}

Rejection Region:
\begin{blockquote}
We will reject if H $> \chi_{0.05, 4}^{2}$ \\
$\chi_{0.05, 4}^{2} = 9.488$
\end{blockquote}

Conclusion/Interpretation
\begin{blockquote}
Since our Test Statistic is greater than 9.488, we have significant evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis that the all the medians are the same.  There does appear to be at least one median that is different than the rest.   
\end{blockquote}
